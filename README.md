# Venture-City
Its an platform for the teachers and learners to meet and get benefits from each other.First index.php is to be loaded and get the information for their sign up and at the time their location access is requested and after getting the access.we store the lattitude and longitude of their location with the details of the user.Then login to enter the map page to display the people around our locatiion and then enter the chat room to discuss with the people you want to speak.after completion we can log out anytime.

I have included jquery and bootstrap libraries into the html pages and php to better understanding and an high tech look which is the main motive of designing and also few of the animations that i have used.
